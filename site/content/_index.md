After living in London more than 6 years, we came back home with our heads full of ideas and our minds in search of a sustainable life in Nakhonrajchasima, Thailand. We think we can bring something we have experienced abroad into this place. So we're planing to build a house where we live sustainably and creatively, a place where trees take over man-made buildings, a space where passion leads our lives. And we'd love to share it to the people we know.
